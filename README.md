### A Vim plugin to engage with lisps (primarily clojure)

I'm building this plugin up using vader to drive a TDD approach.

reading the paredit.el emacs minor mode
paredit.vim, vim-sexp and my previous attempt vim-lispy

### Task List

- When inserting new parens before another a space should be inserted
    e.g (time) (second (X...)) not (time)(second (X...))
