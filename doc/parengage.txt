===========================================================================

Parengage helps you to write sexps more easily by assisting with things
like balancing parenthesis.

splicing - (paredit M-s equivalent)

slurping
and barfing

cut out current sexp with d% (vanilla vim...)

kicking - throwing the closest paren to the end of next whole sexp
and zipping - brings the furthest paren from the end of the next whole sexp
